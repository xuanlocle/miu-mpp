Error come from removeDuplicates method. The Hashmap is using to check the existing of Employee.
HashMap.containsKey(e) will compare element1.hashcode and element2.hashcode
The hashCode() method is not overridden in Employee class, so it's use default hashCode method of Object.

If we do not override this method then default hashCode() method calculates different hash codes for different objects with same value as well.
If we override the hashCode() method in Employee class to return `Objects.hash(name, salary)`, it will work.
