The error comes from the listsAreEqual method and the Employee.equals method.
The List.contains(e) method calls the equals method from the Object superclass of Employee.
Although the Employee class has an equals(Employee) method, it's not an override of the equals(Object) method (due to differing parameter types).

If we do not override the equals(Object) method, the equals method will only check the difference in references for both objects in the heap.
If we override the equals(Object) method correctly, it will work.
